# AlgorithmicTome
This repository was created to study the algorithms and data structures using the book "Computer Science for the Self -Education Programmer". Here you will find the implementation of key algorithms and data structures described in this classical book. My goal is to provide a resource for training, discussing and improving programming skills.
